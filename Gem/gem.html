				<p class="card-text">In this game the player has to find a hidden gem in a 3 by 3 grid. When the page is loaded the gem is randomly placed in the grid (but not shown to the player). The player must make a guess between 1 and 9 with the grid cells numbered from 1 in the upper left, and going across each row with 9 in the lower right. When the player makes an incorrect guess the spot in the grid is marked with an “O” and a message “Try again” is displayed. The player continues to guess until the gem location is found. When the gem is found an “X” is placed in that spot and a message is displayed congratulating the player. Also, if the player inputs an invalid number for cell a message is displayed correcting them. A player can also reset the board by clicking a button “Clear”.</p>
