				"data": "THE SPIKE PLATE on Nikeâ€™s Zoom Superfly Eliteâ€”one of Nikeâ€™s new track shoes for this summerâ€™s Olympicsâ€”looks surprisingly glam-rock, for a piece of athletic wear. Itâ€™s metallic, bluish-purple, and sports an amorphous, latticed spike plate. The bizarre design looks like a piece of coral mated with a disco ball, but its performance benefits are incredible. It can shave a runnerâ€™s 100-meter-dash time down by more than a tenth of a secondâ€”enough time to turn a fourth-place finisher into a gold medalist."
